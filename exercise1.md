Setting up a CI/CD pipeline consists of many things including linting, testing, building and choosing where those are setup. In this essay I will briefly discuss how a Python application CI could be setup.

Linting in a Python CI setup could be done with Ruff, which is especially fast. Another option could be Flake8 which is not so fast but is highly customizable and accurate. For testing a great framework could be pytest which can be used to write various types of tests including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. As Python is an interpreted language the build step doesn't consist of compiling, and therefore the build step might not be so significant and consists of for example installing dependencies.

Setting up the CI with self-hosted setup could be done with CircleCI. Cloud-based solutions could be for example Gitlab CI/CD or Bitbucket Pipelines. Considering that there are 6 people working on the application making the application probably a small project, a cloud-based solution could be better. Cloud-based solutions are easier to setup and usually are cheaper for smaller applications. Also considering that the application is going to be released for the first time it is probably not a large application and therefore a own server is not needed and the processing power that a cloud-based solution offers is enough.
